## ONNX Inference - Style transfer (Pointilism)

### Task

Find out more about OpenVINO Toolkit:
- what *exactly* is it for, what can you do with it?
- where can you learn how to use it?
- where can you download it from?

Try to get a general idea about OpenVINO, and when you're ready, install 2022.1 release and run inference on the linked Pointilism-9.onnx model and the example coco_square.jpg image (or use any other image, if you wish!)

**Goal:** run inference and display results as a new (style-transfered) image
